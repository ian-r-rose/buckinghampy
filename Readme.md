# Buckinghampy
Teaching tool for the Buckingham Pi theorem.  With a terribly obvious name.

Buckinghampy is a pure python package. You can run it locally, or install it to your 
Python distribution by running
```
python setup.py install
```
in the `buckinghampy` directory.

The package relies on the great sympy package.
